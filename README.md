# qualityControl
The purpose of this script is to quality control of raw sequencing data. Either paired-end or single-end reads could be used as inputs under compressed (.gz) or uncompressed format. Five steps are included to get clean reads with high quality: 1. Duplicated reads caused by PCR amplification are removed; 2. Reads with excess of "N"s are discarded. 3. Bases at both ends with low quality are removed.
